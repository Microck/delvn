# Logo Prompts for Delvn (Threat Fusion)

**Project Context**: Delvn is a multi-agent cyber threat intelligence pipeline that ingests CVE, intel, and security news signals, correlates related items, prioritizes against a stack profile, and outputs an executive-ready markdown brief.

**Suggested Vibe**: Technical, authoritative, signal-over-noise, executive-ready

**Signature Ingredients**:
- Artifacts: CVE + intel + RSS feeds, correlation links, stack profile keywords, executive markdown brief
- Actions: ingest, normalize, correlate, prioritize, brief
- Metaphor: signal funnel into a brief
- Avoid: generic shields/locks, matrix code, skulls/hackers, globes, generic radar

## Color Palette

| Role | Color | Hex | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Primary | Deep Obsidian | `#1a1d23` | Serious, premium base for CTI and leadership-facing reporting |
| Secondary | Signal Cyan | `#00d4aa` | The signal emerging from noise; distinct from generic security blue |
| Accent | Priority Amber | `#f59e0b` | Risk highlight and triage emphasis without panic-red |
| Neutral | Steel Smoke | `#64748b` | Supporting elements for docs and UI without stealing focus |

**Palette Story**: Obsidian is the noise and gravity of security work. Cyan is the signal you extract. Amber is what you must act on.

## Prompt 1: Abstract Geometric - Funnel to Brief
```
abstract geometric logo for Delvn, three thin feed lines merging into a clean funnel shape that outputs a single markdown document icon with three bullet bars, sleek geometric, flat Signal Cyan #00d4aa on white, centered, balanced negative space, Swiss design --ar 1:1 --stylize 70 --seed 101 --no gradient --no drop shadow --no bevel --no 3D --no reflection --no photo --no texture --no background scene --no glow --no complex lighting
```

Concept: Visualizes the full pipeline: multiple signals become one executive brief.

---

## Prompt 2: Monoline - Three Feeds, One Narrative
```
monoline logo for Delvn, continuous single stroke forming three input lines that weave into one page outline (brief) with a single highlighted dot, precise geometry, two-color Deep Obsidian #1a1d23 stroke with Signal Cyan #00d4aa highlight, centered on white, badge-ready --ar 1:1 --stylize 66 --seed 112 --no gradient --no drop shadow --no bevel --no 3D --no reflection --no photo --no texture --no background scene --no glow --no complex lighting
```

Concept: A single continuous line implies orchestration and correlation without using generic network nodes.

---

## Prompt 3: Negative Space - CVE Tag Cutout
```
negative-space logo for Delvn, solid document icon where the corner fold forms a tag-like cutout (CVE label shape) and one bullet row is emphasized, bold reduction, flat Deep Obsidian #1a1d23 on white, centered, balanced negative space, modernist --ar 1:1 --stylize 68 --seed 77 --no gradient --no drop shadow --no bevel --no 3D --no reflection --no photo --no texture --no background scene --no glow --no complex lighting
```

Concept: The CVE label and executive brief are embedded as shapes, not text.

---

## Prompt 4: Lettermark - D from Brief Cards
```
lettermark logo for Delvn, stylized capital D built from three stacked rounded-rectangle "brief cards" with one inner alignment line like a markdown bullet, refined proportions, flat Deep Obsidian #1a1d23 with Signal Cyan #00d4aa accent edge, centered on white, balanced negative space --ar 1:1 --stylize 70 --seed 203 --no gradient --no drop shadow --no bevel --no 3D --no reflection --no photo --no texture --no background scene --no glow --no complex lighting
```

Concept: A D monogram that stays tied to the reporting output (cards/brief) rather than abstract cyber imagery.

---

## Prompt 5: Pictorial Symbol - Executive Brief Highlight
```
pictorial logo for Delvn, minimal markdown document icon with three bullet lines and one highlighted bullet dot, bold reduction, two-color Deep Obsidian #1a1d23 with Priority Amber #f59e0b highlight, centered on white, balanced negative space, Sagi Haviv style --ar 1:1 --stylize 72 --seed 88 --no gradient --no drop shadow --no bevel --no 3D --no reflection --no photo --no texture --no background scene --no glow --no complex lighting
```

Concept: Delvn's value is prioritization; the highlight bullet makes triage explicit.

---

## Prompt 6: Emblem/Badge - Triage Seal
```
emblem logo for Delvn, circular seal containing a funnel icon feeding into a small brief page with a single star marker, stamp-ready, flat Deep Obsidian #1a1d23 with Priority Amber #f59e0b accent, centered on white, refined proportions --ar 1:1 --stylize 70 --seed 156 --no gradient --no drop shadow --no bevel --no 3D --no reflection --no photo --no texture --no background scene --no glow --no complex lighting
```

Concept: Works well in decks and docs as a "briefing" stamp.

---

## Prompt 7: Tech-minimal - Correlation Link to Bullet
```
tech-minimal logo for Delvn, grid-aligned correlation glyph where a single link line connects two small blocks and resolves into a short bullet list on the right, precise geometry, flat Steel Smoke #64748b with Signal Cyan #00d4aa accent, centered on white, architectural minimal --ar 1:1 --stylize 63 --seed 301 --no gradient --no drop shadow --no bevel --no 3D --no reflection --no photo --no texture --no background scene --no glow --no complex lighting
```

Concept: CorrelationLink plus reporting, rendered as a single compact icon.

## Recommended Prompt (Recommended)

**Use**: Prompt 1

**Why**:
- Closest semantic match to the product: multiple feeds -> one executive brief
- Distinct from generic CTI logos because it shows the brief output, not a shield/radar
- Reads well small (funnel + page silhouette stays legible)

**Runner-ups**:
- Prompt 5: best if you want the most favicon-friendly icon for the brief output
- Prompt 4: best if you want a lettermark for brand recognition in headers
