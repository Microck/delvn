# Logo Prompts for Delvn

**Project Context**: Multi-agent cyber threat intelligence pipeline that turns noisy CVE, threat intel, and security news feeds into a prioritized executive brief. Six specialized agents collect, correlate, and prioritize threats based on your tech stack.

**Suggested Vibe**: Technical, professional, security-focused, modern

## Design Notes

**Recommended Colors** (for secondary application):
- Primary: Deep navy `#0A1628` or dark slate `#1E293B`
- Accent: Amber `#F59E0B` (alert/warning) or Teal `#14B8A6` (security/trust)
- Mono: Pure white on dark, or pure black on light

**Rationale**:
- **Geometric/hexagonal forms** evoke security architecture and structured intelligence
- **Network/node patterns** represent the multi-agent system
- **Shield motifs** are classic cybersecurity but should be abstracted to avoid cliché
- **Radar/sweep concepts** connect to threat detection and monitoring
- **Fusion/convergence imagery** directly maps to the product name and function
- **Single-stroke/monoline** style fits the CLI/developer tool aesthetic

**Avoid**:
- Literal lock icons
- Generic globe/world imagery
- Overly aggressive "cyber" aesthetics (matrix code, circuit boards)
- Multiple colors (keep mono for versatility)
