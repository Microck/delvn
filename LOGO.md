# Logo Prompts for Delvn (Threat Fusion)

**Project Context**: Multi-agent cyber threat intelligence pipeline that transforms CVE feeds, threat intel, and security news into prioritized executive briefs. Built for security teams who need to cut through noise and focus on what matters.
**Suggested Vibe**: Technical, authoritative, intelligent — serious without being sterile

---

## Color Palette

| Role | Color | Hex | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----|-----------|
| Primary | Deep Obsidian | `#1a1d23` | Commands authority, reflects the serious nature of threat intelligence. Dark enough to feel premium, warm enough to avoid cold corporate vibes. |
| Secondary | Electric Cyan | `#00d4aa` | Represents insight and discovery — the "signal" emerging from noise. Distinct from typical security blue, with a slightly teal cast that feels modern. |
| Accent | Alert Amber | `#f59e0b` | For priority and urgency. Security tools need to highlight risk; amber communicates warning without the panic of red. |
| Neutral | Steel Smoke | `#64748b` | For supporting text and secondary elements. Cool enough to recede, warm enough to avoid feeling sterile. |

**Palette Story**: Obsidian anchors the brand in seriousness. Electric Cyan represents the intelligence breakthrough — finding the signal in noise. Alert Amber flags what demands attention. Together, they say: "We find threats. We tell you what matters."

## Usage Notes

**Primary applications:**
- Dark mode UI: Use Electric Cyan on Deep Obsidian background
- Light mode UI: Deep Obsidian marks with Cyan accents
- Priority indicators: Alert Amber for high-risk items
- Print/dark backgrounds: Full-contrast white variants

**Avoid:**
- Gradients (weakens the technical authority)
- Rounded/cute shapes (undermines the serious domain)
- Multiple accent colors in single mark (dilutes impact)
- Photorealistic or 3D effects (looks dated in security context)
