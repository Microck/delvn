## Script

Delvn. An autonomous Cyber Threat Intelligence platform that filters the noise and prioritizes the risks that actually matter to your enterprise.

Every day, security teams are flooded with thousands of CVEs, vulnerability reports, and security news. Sifting through this avalanche of data to find what threatens your specific tech stack is a massive bottleneck.

Here's how Delvn works.

Our collection swarm pulls data from NVD, AlienVault, and breaking news feeds. A Correlation Engine then uses vector search to link these disparate data points together. 

But the real magic is the Prioritization Agent. It cross-references these correlated threats against your company's actual infrastructure profile, producing a tailored executive brief.

Let me show you a pipeline run. Our mock enterprise uses Apache, PostgreSQL, and React. 

The collection agents have just gathered dozens of raw reports. The correlation engine is scoring them based on confidence and impact.

Now look at the output. 

Delvn generated a clean, actionable brief. It filtered out the noise and highlighted a critical PostgreSQL vulnerability, linking it directly to active chatter on hacker forums. 

It also flagged an emerging Apache risk, skipping the irrelevant iOS and Windows threats entirely. 

From global noise to targeted intelligence in seconds.

Built for the Microsoft AI Dev Days Hackathon twenty twenty-six. Thank you for watching.
